## PART 1: DIGITAL DESIGN THEORY 



 

## PART 2: DIGITAL DESIGN LAB

### TASK1

#### DESIGN 
Describe the design of your system by providing the following information:
  - Verilog design (provide the Verilog code)

#### SIMULATION
Describe how you build the test bench and do the simulation . 
  - Using Verilog(provide the Verilog code)
  - Wave form of simulation result (provide screen shots )

#### CONSTRAINT FILE AND THE TESTING
Describe how you test your design on the Minisys Practice platform . 
  - Constraint file(provide the screen shots on the feature of a pin and the binding info between pins and the input /output ports)
  - The testing result(provide the screen shots(at least 3 testing scene)) to show state of inputs and outputs.

#### THE DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION
Describe the operation on Vivado and Minisys practice platform, from building a project, to program the device and test it on the Minisys practice plate form，along with any relevant information you consider important.
  - The operation steps
  - Problems and solutions

### Task2

#### DESIGN 
Describe the design of your system by providing the following information:
  - Verilog design while using data flow (provide the Verilog code)
  - Verilog design while using structured design (provide the Verilog code)
  - Block design(provide screen shots)

#### SIMULATION
Describe how you build the test bench and do the simulation . 
  - Using Verilog(provide the Verilog code)
  - Wave form of simulation result (provide screen shots )

#### CONSTRAINT FILE AND THE TESTING
Describe how you test your design on the Minisys Practice platform . 
  - Constraint file(provide the screen shots on the feature of a pin and the binding info between pins and the input /output ports)
  - The testing result(provide the screen shots(at least 3 testing scene)) to show state of inputs and outputs. 

#### THE DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION
Describe the operation while do the block design, from set IP repertory in project to using IP do the design,along with any relevant information you consider important .
  - The operation steps
  - Problems and solutions
